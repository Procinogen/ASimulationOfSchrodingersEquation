Hello!
|NEXT|
My name is Erwin!
|NEXT|
Erwin the electron!
|NEXT|
I'm here to teach you about|PAUSE|.|PAUSE|.|PAUSE|.
|NEXT|
Quantum mechanics! |PAUSE| Specifically, Schrodinger's equation.
|NEXT|
You're probably asking, "What even is Schrodinger's equation?"
|NEXT|
To understand, we need to take a look at classical mechanics. |PAUSE|
You're probably familiar with F = ma, right? |PAUSE| If not, here's a little recap:
|NEXT|
F = ma is basically the quintessential formula in all of classical mechanics. |PAUSE|
Using this formula, we're able to derive everything we need to know about a system or an individual object.
(Kinetic energy, momentum, etc.)
|NEXT|
But what does this actually *mean*? |PAUSE|
F represents the net force. |PAUSE|
m represents the object (or system's) mass. |PAUSE|
And a represents the object (or system's) acceleration.
|NEXT|
Now with that said, we can finally talk about schrodinger's equation. |PAUSE|
You can think of schrodinger's equation as the quantum-equivalent of F = ma.
|NEXT|
Here's what the equation looks like.
|NEXT|
This h-looking symbol (pronounced h-bar) represents the planck length divided by 2 times pi. It's one of the scientific constants like the speed of light. |PAUSE|
It's basically the smallest measurement of length that scientists have been able to find.
|NEXT|
This represents Psi. It's a function that represents the shape of the wave function. |PAUSE|
This will change depending on the rest of the equation (because it would be a different situation each time). |PAUSE|
The one you see here is shorthand, as it's a function determined in terms of space in time. Ψ(x,t)
|NEXT|
This V(x) is a function that is representative of the particle's potential energy. |PAUSE|
It's represented in terms of x.
|NEXT|
X denotes the particle's position in space.
|NEXT|
If you know your calculus you should have been able to spot that at various points in the equation, we're finding derivatives.|PAUSE|
Here, we're finding the derivative of Psi with respect to time. |PAUSE|
This is actually the quantum operator (basically just meaning that we can write it shorthand as a function) for the particles total energy.
|NEXT|
This whole chunk here is the operator representing the particle's kinetic energy. |PAUSE|
The m here represents the paricle's mass, as usual.
|NEXT|
So what does this mean? This equation tells us that the particle's energy level are equal the potential energy plus its kinetic energy.|PAUSE|
If we know the particle's total energy, we can derive everything we'd need to know about this particle.
|NEXT|
You can actually derive this from classical energy equation (E = KE + PE).|PAUSE|
However, this is beyond the scope of this presentation.
|NEXT|
Despite what I said earlier about classical and quantum mechanics being separated, everything actually has a wave function (Ψ). |PAUSE|
However, the wave function is inversely proportional the mass. Anything larger than a molecule has a completely negligble wave function.
|NEXT|
Anyways, like I said earlier, using Schrodinger's equation, we can derive everything we'd need to know about a quantum particle. |PAUSE|
Including the wave function.
|NEXT|
However, this can get *really* messy really quickly, so we'll make some assumptions.
|NEXT|
First,  let's assume that this particle is in a square box. This box is inpenetrable by the particle (it's infinitely thick).
|NEXT|
Now let's assume that his box has an infinite height.|PAUSE| We can negate the equation's potential energy because v(x) would be zero when inside the box, and infinitely high outside the box.
|NEXT|
That might not make sense at first, but the reason this works is because systems will want to decrease or reduce stress onto them. |PAUSE|
Think of a ball being lifted from the ground. It gains potential energy, but as soon as you stop doing work on it, it falls, and its potential energy goes back to zero.
