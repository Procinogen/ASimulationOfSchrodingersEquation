Hello!

My name is Erwin!

I'm here to teach you about|PAUSE|.|PAUSE|.|PAUSE|.
|NEXT|
Quantum mechanics! |PAUSE| Specifically, Schrodinger's equation.
|NEXT|
You're probably asking, "What even is Schrodinger's equation?"
|NEXT|
To understand, we need to take a look at classical mechanics. |PAUSE|
You're probably familiar with F = ma, right? |PAUSE| If not, here's a little recap:
|NEXT|
F = ma is basically the quintessential formula in all of classical mechanics. |PAUSE|
Using this formula, we're able to derive everything we need to know about a system or an individual object.
(Kinetic energy, momentum, etc.)
|NEXT|
But what does this actually *mean*? |PAUSE|
F represents the net force. |PAUSE|
m represents the object (or system's) mass. |PAUSE|
And a represents the object (or system's) acceleration.
|NEXT|
Now with that said, we can finally talk about schrodinger's equation. |PAUSE|
You can think of schrodinger's equation as the quantum-equivalent of F = ma.
|NEXT|
Here's what the equation looks like.
|NEXT|
This h-looking symbol (pronounced h-bar) represents the planck length divided by 2 times pi. It's one of the scientific constants like the speed of light. |PAUSE|
It's basically the smallest measurement of length that scientists have been able to find.
|NEXT|
This represents Psi. It's a function that represents the shape of the wave function. |PAUSE|
This will change depending on the rest of the equation (because it would be a different situation each time).
